# Conversation History: Multi-Agent Coding Collaboration Framework

This document records the conversation history of the project setup.

## Conversation Log

### User Request (2026-07-10 22:59:43)
The user requested to design and implement a Multi-Coding Agent Collaboration Framework integrating Codex, Claude Code (DeepSeek API), and Antigravity.
Requested workflow: Research, Refine Requirements, Find References, Determine Technical Route/Plan, Execution, Version Management, Log Preservation, Process Recording, System Deployment & Testing.

### Antigravity Response (2026-07-10 23:00:19)
- Reviewed the workflow and confirmed its feasibility.
- Summarized research: Git worktrees for workspace isolation, Git-native task board formats, dynamic context files (like CLAUDE.md).
- Proposed division of labor:
  - Claude Code: Logic developer (code logic, unit tests).
  - Antigravity: Architect and Visual QA.
  - Codex: IDE-integrated manual adjustments.
- Created `research_and_requirements.md` in the workspace.
- Drafted `implementation_plan.md` in the artifacts.

### User Request (2026-07-10 23:03:33)
Confirmed options:
- Claude Code CLI is `claude`.
- Codex is manually integrated.
- Python 3 and Git are installed.
- Requested to transfer workspace to D: drive due to low space on C: drive.

### Antigravity Response (2026-07-10 23:07:40)
- Transferred all files and workspace paths to `D:\multi_agent_collaboration` and worktrees to `D:\multi_agent_worktrees`.
- Updated the implementation plan and research report.

### User Request (2026-07-10 23:12:57)
- Pointed out that Antigravity should be included in the workflow as a first-class agent.
- Requested to integrate detailed research findings and references directly into the implementation plan.

### Antigravity Response (2026-07-10 23:13:16)
- Updated `implementation_plan.md` to version 2, incorporating Antigravity as a first-class agent (using `D:\multi_agent_worktrees` and task-specific `.agents/AGENTS.md` context files, manually prompted in this chat with operations restricted to the worktree folder).
- Added detailed research notes (Claude Code worktrees, STORM/Augment, Beads/Agent-Tasks board).
- Initialized the Git repository at `D:\multi_agent_collaboration`.
- Created this history log file.
